# Hollow Plugin Template

This repository hosts a template for creating plugins for Hollow. While you can use any UI framework you prefer, it is recommended to use lightweight frameworks like **Svelte** to ensure better performance due to their small footprint and minimal resource usage.
```ts
const test = "test";
```
